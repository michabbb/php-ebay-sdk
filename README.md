# This is a simple SDK for the eBay APIs: trading, shopping, finding

`src_findinng` and `src_trading` and `src_shopping` have been created with https://github.com/WsdlToPhp/PackageGenerator
the rest are wrappers to make this auto-generated stuff working.

The PHP 5 Code workes fine, but you wonÂ´t see any updates or bufixes here. 

**To get the latest code, please look into the branch [php8](https://github.com/michabbb/php-ebay-sdk/tree/php8)**
